**PROJECT   TYPE:** Custom

**PROJECT   TITLE:** Correlation    of  Fast    Food    Joints  density and chronic diseases    in  the USA.    

**DATA  SOURCES:**

1. US   Department  of  Health  and Human   Services.
    - Nutrition,    Physical    Activity,   and Obesity - Behavioural Risk  Factor  Surveillance System

    - Domain:   Federal 
    - Description:  This     dataset     includes    data    on  adult's     diet,   physical    activity, and weight   status  from    Behavioural Risk    Factor  Surveillance    System. This    data    is  used    for DNPAO's Data,   Trends, and Maps.   
2. US   Department  of  Health  and Human   Services.
    - Specific: Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. 
    - [Link](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/center-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services-cms-medicare-claims-data)
    - Domain:   Federal 
    - Description:  This    dataset includes    Inpatient   and Outpatient  claims, Master  Beneficiary Summary  Files,  and     many    other   files.  Indicators  from    this    data    source  have    been computed   by  personnel   in  CDC's   Division    for     Heart   Disease     and     Stroke  Prevention (DHDSP).    This    is  one of  the datasets    provided    by  the National    Cardiovascular  Disease Surveillance     System.     The     system  is  designed    to  integrate   multiple    indicators  from   many    data    sources to  provide a   comprehensive   picture of  the public  health  burden  of  CVDs    and associated  risk    factors in  the United  States.
3. Fast Food    joint   distribution    in  the United  States. 
    - [Link](http://www.fastfoodmaps.com/data.html)
    - Domain:   Federal 
    - Description:  Author wrote    scrapers    for other   major   fast    food    chains  and produced    a list  of  50,000  locations   in  the US. Using   the site,   people  can go  to  any location    in  the US  and see the major   fast    food    restaurants there.  Authorâ€™s intention  wasn't  to  make   it   easier  for people  to  find    fast    food,   nor was it  to  criticize   the ubiquity    of  fast    food.          Rather   he  was interested  in  the visualization,  the graphical   portrayal   of  information.       These    graphics    convey  something   that    is  true    about   the US. 

**TOOLS NEEDED:**

1. [CSV to  RDF converters](https://www.w3.org/wiki/ConverterToRdf)
2. Apache   Jena    Fuseki
3. [Google  Charts  APIs](https://developers.google.com/chart/)
4. SPARQL   Queries (for    data    manipulation)
5. Python, Flask, SPARQLWrapper

**BASIC SCHEDULE:**

1. Team will    meet    for 4   hours   every   week    (Mon-Tue    11am-1pm).  
2. Individual   tasks   will    be  discussed,  distributed and integrated. 
3. Milestone    1:  
    a. Date:    16th October,   
       i. Convert   data    to  appropriate RDF formats
ii. Make    sure    the tools,  data    and approach    of  the project is  on  the right   track.  
iii. APIs   are identified. Read    up  how to  use them.
4. Milestone    2:
    a. Date:    24th October,   
       i. Check readiness   for first   checkpoint  of  presentation.
5. Milestone    3:
    a. Date:     6 th November, 
       i. First version of  output  with    all integrations    and queries working.    

**EXPECTED  RESULTS:**

The correlation is  established showing the density distribution    of  fast    food    joints  with    health  
diseases.   Also,   the relationship    between Medicare    claims  and heart   related diseases is shown. The  
result  will    be  output  using   Google  Charts  API,    marking the geographical    locations   with    the data    
obtained    from    the RDF datasets.

**BRAINSTORM    SESSION:**

On  brainstorming   for different project ideas,    each    one of  us  come    with    the following   respective  
ideas:

1. Amruta   Folane:
    Prices  of  houses  in  an  area    in  relation    with    the salaries of the people  in  the same    area.
2. Ashish   Mohapatra:
    Imdb    movie   ratings in  relation    with    their   box office  collection.
